Task List

You may do these tasks in any order, but take note that they are listed in
the order your team has prioritized completing them.

Reminder that you are NOT expected to complete all tasks. You are
expected to write clean, readable code. Remember to add comments explaining
what you were working on if you run out of time in the middle of a task.

1.  In order to display the list of places in our web app, we first need to get
    the place and image data from two different REST API endpoints. In
    data/placeData.js, implement

    function loadPlacesWithImages() { ... }

    The place list data can be obtained by making a GET request to
    https://byteboard.dev/api/data/places
    You can get the image URL for each place by making a GET request to
    https://byteboard.dev/api/data/img/{placeId}

2.  Users should be able to filter the list of places by using the "Filter
    places" input field. In components/placeList.js, implement

    function getFilteredPlaces(places, filter) { ... }

    We want to surface the most relevant search results, so places where the
    `name` field matches should appear higher than places where the `address` or
    `description` fields match.

3.  When a user clicks on a place from the list, we want to navigate them to a
    page that has all of the details for that place. (Hint: use
    `navigateToPlace` in helpers/navigation.js). You will also need to add the
    place image and finish the styling so that the place page matches the
    wireframe in the Part 1 document.
